    question:
      "Why do some people feel like time moves faster as they get older?",
    answer:
      "As we age, each year becomes a smaller fraction of our total life experience. For example, a year is 10% of a 10-year-old's life, but only 2% of a 50-year-old's life. Additionally, as adults, we experience fewer 'firsts' (e.g., first day of school, first bike ride), and our brain encodes fewer distinct memories. This makes time feel like it’s speeding up because there are fewer significant events anchoring those years in our memory.",

    question: "If AI could dream, what would it dream about?",
    answer:
      "AI lacks consciousness, so it can’t dream in the human sense. But theoretically, if AI could dream, it might 'dream' in the form of random recombinations of the data it’s trained on—like a chaotic montage of cats, stock market trends, faces, and code snippets. Its dreams might represent attempts to optimize incomplete tasks or explore abstract patterns beyond its programmed objectives.",
